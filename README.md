## Overview

This project is a machine learning web application that evaluates whether second-hand accounting textbooks are fairly priced, underpriced, or overpriced. Unlike many academic projects, this application is built on real-world data collected manually, making it highly practical and market-oriented.

The application demonstrates how data science can be used to support informed decision-making in student marketplaces.

## Problem Statement

Students often struggle to determine whether second-hand textbooks are priced fairly. This project addresses that gap by analysing historical second-hand book listings and using machine learning to classify pricing fairness.

## Application Architecture

Backend: Flask (Python)

Model Serving: Trained model loaded and used for real-time predictions

Frontend: HTML/CSS forms for user input

Prediction Flow:

- User enters book details

- Backend processes features

- Model predicts pricing category

- Result displayed with clear interpretation
