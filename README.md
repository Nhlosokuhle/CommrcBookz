# PersonaCheck

## Overview

This project is a machine learning–powered web application that classifies a user as Introverted or Extroverted based on their responses to a structured questionnaire. The application demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline, from data generation and model training to deployment as a web service.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase applied machine learning integrated into a production-style web application.

## Problem Statement

Personality traits are often assessed using structured questionnaires. This project explores how such responses can be mapped to personality categories using supervised machine learning and served through a user-facing application.

## Application Architecture

Backend: Flask (Python)

Model Serving: Trained model loaded and used for real-time predictions

Frontend: HTML/CSS forms for user input

Prediction Flow:

- User answers questionnaire

- Inputs sent to Flask backend

- Model generates prediction

- Result returned and displayed to user

## Usage
After following the installation instructions, you should be able to access the project by navigating to http://localhost:80 in your web browser. From there, you can create the account and access the notes page.
